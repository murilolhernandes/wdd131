          <h2>South Africa</h2>
          <p class="info">The South Africa national rugby union team, commonly known as the Springboks, is the country's national team governed by the South African Rugby Union. The Springboks play in green and gold jerseys with white shorts, and their emblem is the Springbok, a native antelope and the national animal of South Africa.</p>
          <p class="info">Currently, the Springboks are the reigning World Champions, having won the World Cup a record four times (1995, 2007, 2019 and 2023). South Africa are the only team to have won half of the Rugby World Cups they have participated in, and are also the second nation to win the World Cup consecutively (2019 and 2023).</p>
          <h3>2023 Rugby World Cup</h3>
          <p class="info">The Springboks faced a tough pool that included the likes of Ireland and Scotland. They suffered a narrow defeat to Ireland. However, they bounced back with convincing victories in the remaining pool matches.</p>
          <p class="info"><span class="quote">Quarter Final vs France:</span> In a nail-biting encounter against the host nation, the Springboks fought tenaciously throughout the match. The score remained close, but their determination paid off as they emerged victorious with a final score of 29‚Äì28.</p>
          <p class="info"><span class="quote">Semi Final vs England:</span> Another tense affair, this game tested the Springboks' grit. They battled fiercely against England, with the score seesawing throughout. Displaying nerves of steel, the Springboks clinched the win with a last-minute penalty, ending the game at 16‚Äì15.</p>
          <p class="info"><span class="quote">Final vs New Zealand:</span> A thrilling 80 minutes that kept fans on the edge of their seats. The All Blacks were reduced to 14 men in the first half after captain Sam Cane was sent off for a dangerous tackle. Despite their numerical advantage, the Springboks faced strong defense from New Zealand. However, they managed to secure a narrow victory, with the final score at 12‚Äì11.</p>
          <p class="info">The 2023 Springboks were a team that embodied the spirit of unity. Their diverse squad, with players from various backgrounds and cultures, came together under the banner of "Together in One Nation, One Team."          </p>
          <p class="info">The Springboks were crowned Rugby World Cup champions for the fourth time, making them the first nation to win 4 titles and their second in a row. Having only played 8 tournaments, this has given South Africa a <strong>50% win rate</strong> at World Cups.          </p>
